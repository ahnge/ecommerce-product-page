## My process

### Built with

- Next.js
- Redux
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I learn Redux for state management. So, do I like redux? I would say not bad. Do I wanna work with redux in the future? It depends on the kind of the project that I am gonna do. I might use plain context API for small projects. But definitely redux for larger projects.

### Useful resources

- [Freecode camp tutorial](https://youtu.be/zrs7u6bdbUw) - This is the tutorial I would recommend to learn Redux. But definitely look for updated resources if you are reading this from vary far future.
